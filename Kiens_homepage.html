		<div id="about">
			<p> Iâ€™m a software product manager for collision repair business management systems at Mitchell International. Previously I was a business analyst on the Service Operations team at Mitchell International.
			</p>
			<p>Prior to tech, I served in AmeriCorps for two years in their Teach For America program. As a high school biology instructor I was responsible for empowering students to overcome their struggles with biology and pass the state exam so that they can graduate high school.
			</p>
			<p>Outside of work, I enjoy reading and learning about how technology trends and how they can transform our lives. I also like to take advantage of the beautiful weather that San Diego year round.
